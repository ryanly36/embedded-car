# embedded-car

Individual embedded car project.
This repository contains the code and documentation for an autonomous light-following embedded car based on the Arduino Nano platform. The embedded car is equipped with two Light-Dependent Resistors (LDRs) to sense ambient light levels and a motor drive controller to control the movements of two motors responsible for the car's locomotion.

Features:

Light Sensing: The car uses LDRs to detect variations in ambient light levels. By comparing the light intensities measured by the two LDRs, the car can discern the direction of the light source.

State Machine Control: The car employs a state machine approach to process the sensor readings and calculate the appropriate motor actions. The state machine adapts the car's behavior based on the light source's direction and intensity.

Motor Control: The car utilizes Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control the speed of the two motors. The control signals for the motor driver are generated by the Arduino Nano and sent to the motor control driver, which then drives the motors connected to the OUT1-4 ports.

Autonomous Behavior: Once powered on, the embedded car autonomously follows the light source. The car can execute precise turns and maneuvers to keep the light source within its optimal sensing range.
